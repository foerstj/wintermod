# Wintermod
A mod that brings winter to the world of Dungeon Siege.

## About
Aim is to convert resources of grass and pine forest environments to snow.\
First priority is on (the beginning of) the Kingdom of Ehb campaign. Utraean Peninsula has less prio, LoA/R2A/Yesterhaven maps even less. Certain biomes like the dry-grass and jungle regions were given up on.

Wintermod works by:
- Overriding terrain textures, e.g. grass -> snow, pine/sequoia-forest -> ice-caves. Some textures only had to be copied, others had to be GIMPed.
- Overriding object textures, e.g. grass/generic -> snow. This is the reason why there are snowy barrels etc. also indoors, there's not much that can be done given this approach. It is also the reason why dry-grass regions look inconsistent now, the terrain has a special texture set but the plants are simply mixed grass & swamp templates.
- Overriding object templates, e.g. various grass bushes were re-defined as snow rhododendrons, various deciduous trees as tree_ice_pine or tree_ice_dead.
- Overriding moods, to change rain -> snow, and make the fog color more cold.

This mod is build to work together with my Christmas mod. If you use both mods, Christmas trees will stand in various locations such as the Farmhouse, Stonebridge, Glacern, or around Castle Ehb.

## Installation & Compatibility
- This mod is made for LoA, but should work fine with Vanilla as well.
- This mod is NOT compatible with SeeFar (mood definition conflict) or Hi-Res Textures (textures conflict). Other mods were not tested.
- Wintermod supports the maps of all original DS1 releases (to a certain degree). It also supports my own maps (to a lesser degree; e.g. rain is replaced with snow also here).

## Attribution
- Polar Ursae texture from Eksevis / Halloween Mod.
- Snow river & ice-caves river textures from DS2.
